# MicroStation + Rhino.Inside - Sample Code

After setting up dependencies and first build, make sure to:
- Open the `MicroStationRhinoInside.cfg` file and edit the variables for your setup (MS_ADDINPATH and MS_RIBBONXML)
- Open the Bentley application's config folder (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\Bentley\MicroStation CONNECT Edition\Configuration\Organization`)
- Copy the `MicroStationRhinoInside.cfg` to the Bentley config folder

You can now start a Visual Studio's debug session for the Bentley application. This will launch the corresponding application for you, and the toolbar to launch sample Rhino.Inside projects should be loaded! The toolbar contains buttons for running the [SampleHelloWorld](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/7/rhino.inside/dotnet/SampleHelloWorld), [SampleRunGrasshopper](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/7/rhino.inside/dotnet/SampleRunGrasshopper) and [SampleWinFormsApp](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/7/rhino.inside/dotnet/SampleWinFormsApp) projects from the Rhino.Inside [developer samples](https://github.com/mcneel/rhino-developer-samples/tree/7/rhino.inside).
