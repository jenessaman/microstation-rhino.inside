# MicroStation + Rhino.Inside - Sample Code

After setting up dependencies and first build, make sure to:
- Open the `MicroStationRhinoInside.cfg` file and edit the variables for your setup (MS_ADDINPATH and MS_RIBBONXML)
- Open the Bentley application's config folder (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\Bentley\MicroStation CONNECT Edition\Configuration\Organization`)
- Copy the `MicroStationRhinoInside.cfg` to the Bentley config folder

You can now start a Visual Studio's debug session for the Bentley application. This will launch the corresponding application for you, and the toolbar to launch sample Rhino.Inside projects should be loaded!
